# Gutenpride

A Gutenberg block to show your pride!

When enabled on WordPress, this plugin creates an editable <b>Gutenpride</b> block using the color font Gilbert from [Type with Pride](https://www.typewithpride.com/)

Example:

<img src="gutenpride-screenshot.png" width="405" />


Note: Browser support for color fonts is still limited, this works with Firefox, see [colorfonts.wtf](https://www.colorfonts.wtf/) for more info.


## Usage

To install on your WordPress site, download repository (or zip) and extract to to your `plugins` directory and activate.

The block will show in the inserter under widgets category within Gutenberg.

Note: You will also need [Gutenberg plugin](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) installed.


## Development

This is primarily a plugin created for me to test Gutenberg, thus there are two versions of the plugin. The main version in the master branch written in ES5 syntax, and a second version on [ESNext branch](https://github.com/mkaz/gutenpride/tree/esnext) which uses ESNext syntax and requires a build step.

Check out the [Gutenberg Handbook JavaScript Tutorial](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/javascript/) for more information.
